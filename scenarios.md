# Scenarios

- **Device Loss/Format**: Like devices wipe, auto-disable opens access after 1 year.
- **Leaked Password**: Disable 2FA pre-leak if suspected; re-enable post-cleanup.
- **Theft**: If thief doesn't use it, inactivity disables 2FA, reclaim with proof later.
- **Forgotten Account**: Rediscover it password-only after timer, re-enable 2FA if you want.

Risk: More hack chance post-disable, but blame inactivity, not the system.
