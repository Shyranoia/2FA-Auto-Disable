# 2FA Auto-Disable Concept

## Overview
This is an original idea by Syranoiax for auto-disabling 2FA on inactive email accounts (like Gmail, ProtonMail, etc).
No reviews, no checks, just notifications and an open door after the timer.
If hacked, blame the owner for inactivity, like Gmail's 2-year deletion policy.
Designed for emails only and higher risk for social media.

### Why This Concept?
2FA protects but locks out owners too (e.g., device resets, lost backups, etc). This fixes it by reverting to password-only after 1–1.5 years inactivity for no-recovery accounts. Fair as non-2FA users.

### Key Principles
- Owner blame: Inactive? Your fault if hacked.
- No reviews: Automated, open the door, no gatekeepers.
- Emails only: Low public risk vs social media.
