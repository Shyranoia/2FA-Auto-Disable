# 2FA Auto-Disable Wiki

Original concept by Syranoiax for auto-disabling 2FA on inactive emails.

## Quick Start
- Read [Overview](/overview.md)
- Mechanics in [Mechanics](/mechanics.md)
- Scenarios in [Scenarios](/scenarios.md)
- Risks in [Risks](/risks.md)

## Why?
2FA locks out owners like me, this resets it after inactivity, no reviews needed. Emails only.

## Reason This Exists!
I got locked out of my Gmail after a devices format wiped my 2FA codes (November 2025).
No backups, no recovery, stuck in a "try again later" loop.
This concept fixes that: 2FA protects until it doesn't, then reverts to password-only.
Fair, simple, and owner-driven. Read more in [overview.md](/overview.md
