# 2FA Auto-Disable Wiki

Original concept by Syranoiax for auto-disabling 2FA on inactive emails.

- Risks in [Risks](/risks.md)

## Why?
2FA locks out owners like me, this resets it after inactivity, no reviews needed. Emails only. And I've been thinking about 2FA, it's not bad, but it's a double-edged sword, which is why I added this feature to complete the yin and yang. (Swords combo China vibes :D) but anyway, it's not anti-2FA, just a fix for its flaws.

## Reason This Exists!
I got locked out of my Gmail after a devices format wiped my 2FA codes (November 2025).
No backups, no recovery, stuck in a "try again later" loop without logouts before wipe devices.
This concept fixes that: 2FA protects until it doesn't, then reverts to password-only.
Fair, simple, and owner-driven. Read more in [overview.md](/overview.md
