# Mechanics

- **Trigger**: 1 year (or 1.5 years) no logins, emails sent, or app activity for accounts without recovery (secondary email/phone).
- **Notifications**: Alerts at 9 months, 1 month, 1 week: "2FA disabling soon, log in or add recovery to pause."
- **Auto-Disable**: At deadline, 2FA off. Password-only access forever, no window, no reset limits.
- **Password Forget?**: Can't help, your problem. Add recovery next time.
- **Post-Disable**: Re-enable 2FA anytime after login, as nothing happened.
