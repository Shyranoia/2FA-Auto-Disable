# Risks & Blame

- **Hack Window**: Password-only = phishing risk, but same as non-2FA users.
- **Owner Blame**: Inactive? Your fault, like Gmail's 2-year deletion.
- **No Safety Net**: Forget password? Locked forever, motivates backups.
- **Mitigation**: Opt-in during 2FA setup; notifications encourage action.

For social media: Too risky, don't use this concept there.
