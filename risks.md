# Risks & Blame

- **Hack Window**: Password-only = phishing risk, but same as non-2FA users.
- **Owner Blame**: Inactive? Your fault, like Gmail's 2-year deletion. Example: If hacked post-disable, blame your weak password or neglect, not the system.
- **No Safety Net**: Forget password? Locked forever, motivates backups. Example: My devices format lost 2FA, but with this, I'd have password access after the timer.
- **Mitigation**: Opt-in during 2FA setup; notifications encourage action.

For social media: Too risky, don't use this concept there.
